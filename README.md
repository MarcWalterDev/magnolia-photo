User experience

	User story

Due to the nature of the service users are unlikely to be returning to the website until they have reached a decision. The photographers work should be displayed in such a way that it encourages the user to look further, so after having a “shop around” will remember videographer when they are ready to make their final decision

Design
	Colour scheme (why)
	Fonts (why)
	Media

Needs to look elegant and weddingy, people want something special for their big day so videographer should be advertised as such. Videographer has an existing logo so colour scheme should be in line with that.

Video should play a big role in the design of website but not be too in your face or obtrusive and should remain modest. Still images should break up video content and have a warm, happy feel that also expresses how videographer can capture the moment
