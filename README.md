## User experience

### User story

As a first time user I want to:

* See what service is on offer.
* Navigate easily through the website.
* See examples of the photographers work.
* See if the photographer is right for me.
* Contact the photographer.

As a returning user I want to:

* Book or contact the photographer.

Due to the nature of the service visitors will unlikely return multiple times other than to book the service or enquire.

## Design

### Colours

I wanted to keep a simple colour scheme to keep the photographs the center of attention, with the majority of the photographs being on the gallery and album pages I used the colour scheme throughout for consistency. I used white for the main colour due to its association with weddings, grey for the main font colour for a softer look, gold/yellow for hover effects as I felt it suited the wedding theme and the green for a splash of colour so it didn't look too plain.

### Typography

Fonts were taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I used [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins) as the main font for its clean, modern look and [Tangerine](https://fonts.google.com/?query=tangerine) for headings to add some elegance with sans serif and cursive, respectively, for back up.

### Media

The photographs in the gallery and album pages were taken from [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/) a free stock photography site. The "reviewers" are friends and family and the photographer is a portarait of myself.

### Wireframes

The site was designed to be a multi page site which is responsive across all device types.
I made a some design choices during the development process which deviate from the original designs.
